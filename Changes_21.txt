Preprocessing:

Complete removal of CLAHE. Switched to histogram equalization.

Changed from Gaussian blur to bilateral filter.

Detection Method Changes:

Removed adaptive thresholding completely - threw off our detection methodology. 
Removed morphological operations (for the time being, as they still do have benefits in isolating squares in the sample images. Will need tuning.)

Square Criteria / Evaluation changes:

Made certain thresholds like the aspect ratio less strict. 
Removed many over-complicated methodologies: 
	Removed extent check
	Removed rotated rectangle code - was messy and didn't work properly.


Overall Structure:

	Simplified approach. Focusing now on basic thresholding rather than multiple methods, and to further build on from there - as we are now getting promising results. The next update will re-integrate complexity.

Only one pass per threshold value, no more multiple types.
Now focuses on solidity (shape quality) rather than extent (filled area)
